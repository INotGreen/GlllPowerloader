Introduction
------------
Invoke-DOSfuscation is a PowerShell v2.0+ compatible cmd.exe command
obfuscation framework. (White paper: [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/03/dosfuscation-exploring-obfuscation-and-detection-techniques.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/03/dosfuscation-exploring-obfuscation-and-detection-techniques.html))

Background
----------
Over the past several years as an Incident Response consultant I have
witnessed a myriad of obfuscation and evasion techniques employed by
several threat actors. Some of these techniques are incredibly complex
while others are tastefully simple, but both categories are employed to
evade detection. In my experience, I have found APT32 and FIN7 to pull
out the most alluring obfuscation techniques and their creativity is
noteworthy.

In June 2017 after a slew of incremental command line obfuscation
techniques, FIN7 used an environment variable string substitution 
capability native to cmd.exe that at the time I did not know even existed.
Spurred by this discovery I co-authored a blog post with Nick Carr ([@ItsReallyNick](https://twitter.com/ItsReallyNick))
called [Obfuscation in the Wild: Targeted Attackers Lead the Way in Evasion Techniques](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/06/obfuscation-in-the-wild.html) where we highighted numerous groups' 
obfuscation techniques we identified in the wild.

The following weekend I explored this native cmd.exe substitution
functionality and built and released a simple Proof-of-Concept tool called [Out-FINcodedCommand](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Out-FINcodedCommand). As soon as I released this POC I stepped back and thought,
_"Maybe there are more obfuscation capabilities within cmd.exe that I
should explore and build detections for before we discover it being used
in the wild."_

That was the inception of my research that eventually led me to develop
this Invoke-DOSfuscation framework.

Purpose
-------
Attackers are increasingly using obfuscation techniques to evade detections
based heavily on command line argument values. To counter this I spent five
months researching and developing obfuscation and encoding techniques native
to cmd.exe so that I could create robust detections for these core techniques
that I have not yet seen in the wild.

**This framework's sole purpose is to enable defenders to randomly generate
thousands of uniquely obfuscated sample commands to test and tune their
detection capabilities against these techniques. I included my full test
harness in this release to automate this detection testing process.**

In many ways this framework enables defenders to fuzz cmd.exe's obfuscation
techniques, and in building this tool I discovered numerous additional 
obfuscation opportunities that I did not uncover in my initial research.

I also shared this information with Microsoft in November 2017 and inquired
about opportunities to expose additional visibility into the inner workings
of cmd.exe's usage of the core techniques that are the building blocks of
all of the obfuscation functions built into this framework.

As a defender the end goal of this research and development is to raise 
awareness and drive change that will help end users better protect themselves
against attackers' ever-changing TTPs (Tools, Techniques and Procedures).

Usage
-----
While all of the obfuscation components are built out into standalone formal
functions, most users will find the `Invoke-DOSfuscation` function to be the
easiest way to explorer and visualize the obfuscation techniques that this
framework supports. For fuzzing and deep exploration of the numerous tuning
options for each obfuscation category, though, it is recommended that the
individual functions be used directly outside of the `Invoke-DOSfuscation`
function wrapper.

To enable defenders to easily begin fuzzing and testing detection ideas, this
framework also includes an additional module, `Invoke-DOSfuscationTestHarness.psm1`
that is automatically imported with the rest of the project. The two key functions
in this module for defenders are:
1) `Invoke-DosTestHarness` - Generates (with default argument settings) over 1000 randomly-obfuscated commands
from a list of test commands for both payload integrity and detection purposes. Each test
harness iteration randomizes all available function arguments and calls the four obfuscation
functions directly instead of using the more standardized `-ObfuscationLevel` values (1-3)
that the Invoke-DOSfuscation menu-driven function uses by default. This produces a significantly wider
range of obfuscation output against which one can build more thorough detections. Each obfuscated
command is then checked against the second function:
2) `Get-DosDetectionMatch` - Checks an input command (string) against all regex detection values
input into the `$regexDetectionTerms` array in the function. This is automatically called by 
`Invoke-DosTestHarness` but can be called in a stand-alone fashion as well.

At the end of each test harness invocation statistics for proper command execution and
detection will be displayed so defenders can quickly identify which commands have 0
or only 1-2 detection matches and which might need better coverage.

Finally, to avoid requiring defenders to have to run the test harness to get started, I have provided
1000 sample commands in the [Samples](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-DOSfuscation/tree/master/Samples)
directory broken out across each of the four obfuscation functions. The formats include .txt files, and Security and Sysmon .evtx files. I included a couple 
sample detection rules in the `$regexDetectionTerms` array in `Invoke-DOSfuscationTestHarness.psm1`,
but you will want to add and test many more rules as you test the sample obfuscated commands). 
In addition to .txt files with the raw commands there are .evtx files containing the process 
execution logs (Sysmon EID 1 events) for each of the 1000 sample commands. These event logs are tremendously 
helpful for building indicators based on nuanced child process executions that are byproducts 
of several building block techniques upon which Invoke-DOSfuscation is built.

To get started, display sample obfuscated commands that do *not* match any of your current detection
rules by simply running:

```(Get-Content .\Samples\STATIC_1-of-4_Out-DosConcatenatedCommand.txt) | where-object { -not (Get-DosDetectionMatch -Command $_).Detected }```

To test both obfuscated commands and child processes from execution event logs recorded in Security EID 4688, simply run:

```(Get-WinEvent -Path .\Samples\DYNAMIC_SECURITY_EID4688_1-of-4_Out-DosConcatenatedCommand.evtx) | where-object { $_.Message } | foreach-object { ($_.Message.Split("`n") | select-string '^\tProcess Command Line:\t') -replace '^\tProcess Command Line:\t','' } | where-object { -not (Get-DosDetectionMatch -Command $_).Detected }```
